# FriendFinder
FriendFinder - a dating app(full-stack site) that takes in results from users' surveys, and compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I used Express to handle the routing. 


How to run the app:

1. Clone this repo.

2. cd to the folder and open Git Bash.

3. Type at the command line: 

A. npm install 
B. node server
C. go to the browser: http://localhost:8080/

4. APP location: https://desolate-falls-77708.herokuapp.com/
